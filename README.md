## Installation

### Dependencies

#### Required

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) (cross-platform build environment)
* [git](https://git-scm.com) (code versioning)

#### Optional

* [doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) (documentation generator)
* [graphviz](http://graphviz.org) (diagram generator)

### Procedure

* Clone the git repository through SSH: `git clone git@github.com:HaplyHaptics/Haply-API-cpp.git`
* Update git submodules in the cloned repository: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* Compile with CMake using your favorite integrated development environment or terminal. Turn CMake option `BUILD_DOC` to `ON` to enable documentation compilation (target: `doc`).

## Contributing

We are open to academic and industrial collaborations! 

### Code conventions

  * Format C++ code with `astyle --style=linux` (see [astyle doc](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/))

## License

The Haply C++ API is a rewrite in C++ by Christian Frisson of the [Haply hAPI Java library](https://github.com/HaplyHaptics/Haply-hAPI/commit/30031d8f6d5a98815545e4f279a4b673161f91f0) written by Colin Gallacher and Steven Ding, therefore it inherits from the same license, updated [GPLv3 License](LICENSE). For serial communication, Haply C++ API uses [our fork](https://github.com/HaplyHaptics/serial) of [William Woodall's cross-platform serial port library](https://github.com/wjwwood/serial), with stripped-down dependencies (catkin and python removed), versioned as git submodule, also released under the terms of the MIT License.

If you want to reuse Haply C++ API for your research and development, you are free to do so as long as you comply with the terms of the [GPLv3 License](LICENSE).
